### More information about me (mostly regarding Pony Town):
+ Feel free to sit beside me if you see me on my own. Let it be known I'll take that as a sign of you wanting to interact/become friends.
+ If you wish to interact with me, use the whisper function. I'm usually off-tab or looking at other things so I'll miss your message otherwise.
+ I tend to hide people if their presence annoys me or if I simply do not enjoy a discussion they're publicily having. In fact, I have a good half of the people in the BSD area hidden. I apologize if I appear to be sitting over/covering anyone due to that.
+ I'm not in a lot of fandoms and my interests change rather slowly but if you're interest, go ahead and ask me about them.

#### About the BSD fandom:
+ My favourite characters are Atsushi, Akutagawa and Higuchi (honourable mention to Kajii). I'll talk a lot about them if given the chance. 
+ Most of the fandom genuinly makes me uncomfortable so I might not be too eager to interact at first. I'll open up as time goes on if we get along.
+ My favourite ship is SSKK (aka AkuAtsu). I have firm opinions about it and will most likely bring it up few times in conversations.
+ If you enjoy rarepairs, I suggest you do not interact with me. I have nothing against them but you people are insufferable to be around. 
+ Leading with my previous statement: I will not respect your ships if I dislike them. I expect the same level of disrespect from anyone who talks to me. Thank you.
