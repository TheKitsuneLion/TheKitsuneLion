### More information about me (mostly regarding Pony Town):
+ Feel free to sit beside me if you see me on my own. Let it be known I'll take that as a sign of you wanting to interact/become friends.
+ If you wish to interact with me, use the whisper function. I'm usually off-tab or looking at other things so I'll miss your message otherwise.
+ As stated in my bio, I am a system. Due to that you might notice changes in my attitude or typing pattern; it is not your fault.
+ I tend to hide people if their presence annoys me or if I simply do not enjoy a discussion they're publicily having. In fact, I have a good half of the people in the BSD area hidden. I apologize if I appear to be sitting over/covering anyone due to that.
+ I'm not in a lot of fandoms and my interests change rather slowly. If you're interest, go ahead and ask me about them.

#### About ships:
+ I'm not an avid shipper, nor do I enjoy having whole conversations about them.
+ Despite that, I still enjoy some ships (such as sskk and ranpoe) and have firm opinions about them.
+ I will not respect your ships if I believe they are absurd and will never "sail". I expect people to give me the same lack of respect regarding my own ships.
+ Leading with what I said before, I suggest you do not interact with me if you enjoy any ship involving Fyodor or Dazai (apart from skk, that one I can tolerate). This is for your own good, I will not hesitate to hate on those ships.
